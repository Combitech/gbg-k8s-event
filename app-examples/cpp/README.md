# Example of containerized C++/CMake app

The [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) shows the basic principles of encapsulating specific build/run instructions described in [application's README](./app/README.md) into an language/stack invariant container image.

> ⚠️ This is ***not*** a demonstration of "best practices" for production-ready container images!

Refer to the general instructions for how to work the containers in the [README of the parent directory](../README.md)
